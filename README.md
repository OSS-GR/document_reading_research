## Document Reading Research

 This is a repository to play around with ingesting different types of documents into Weaviate using Docling.

### Current Repository

``` 
.
├── README.md
├── code
│   └── main.py
├── infra
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── terraform.tfstate
│   └── terraform.tfstate.backup
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```

### Approach
We are using **uv** to manage the python dependencies as well as **terraform** and **docker** to manage our infrastructure setup for **Weaviate**.
